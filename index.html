    <h1>Question 1. > Answer :- </h1>
    <p>
        Bio-inspired design is the application of knowledge of biological systems in research and development to solve technical problems and develop technical inventions and innovations. Also known as biomimetics, biomimetic design, or biomimicry, It refers to the fact that biology has been an important inspiration for developments in all aspects of engineering, for example the design of robots. Bio-inspired computation sensors, actuators, structures and materials have enabled robots to produce robust and comparable behaviours to their biological counterparts.
        As biological solutions can rarely be used in the technical domain directly, bio-inspired design entails a step of abstraction to enable analogical transfer. <br>

    <h2>Some of the examples include</h2>
    <p>
        1. Telescopes inspired by lobster eyes to see more of space to swellable microneedle arrays that provide safer skin grafts, based on an insect with a similar swellable proboscis. <br>
        2. Smart metering, in which the electrical energy draws of individual households are communicated to a central manager, and power production and distribution is meted out in a bottom-up way that avoids shortages and wastes.
        <br>
        3. Companies such as Boston Dynamics and Festo have been successfully mimicking animal locomotion for years, producing the fastest land robot on earth and an incredible vehicle that flies like a bird, respectively. <br>
        4. The endoparasite Pomphorhynchus laevis swells its proboscis to attach to its host's intestinal wall, and the team developed a biphasic microneedle array that mechanically interlocks with tissue through swellable microneedle tips, achieving about a 3.5-fold increase in adhesion strength compared with staples in skin graft fixation. The swellable tips of these micro-cones surround a polystyrene core and have high adhesion strength when swollen. This design provides universal soft tissue adhesion with minimal damage, less traumatic removal, reduced risk of infection and delivery of bioactive therapeutics.
